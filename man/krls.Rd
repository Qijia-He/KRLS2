\title{Main function of KRLS}
\usage{
krls(X, y, w = NULL, loss = "leastsquares", whichkernel = "gaussian",
  b = NULL, optimb = FALSE, lambda = NULL, hyperfolds = 5,
  lambdastart = 0.5, L = NULL, U = NULL, truncate = FALSE,
  lastkeeper = NULL, epsilon = 0.01, con = list(maxit = 500),

}
\description{
This is the primary fitting function. 
By default it uses squared loss
(loss="leastsquares") as one would for a 
continuous outcome, but now also implements
logistic regression with the loss="logistic" option. 
It also allows faster computation and larger
training sets than prior versions by an option 
to approximate the kernel matrix with 
lower dimensional approximation using the 
truncate argument.

The workflow for using KRLS mimics that 
of lm and similar functions:
a krls object of class KRLS2 is fitted in one step, 
then can later be examined using summary(). 
The krls object contains all the information 
that may be needed at summary time, 
including information required to estimate 
pointwise partial derivatives, their average
for each covariate, standard errors, etc. 
via the summary() function. See summary.krls2().
