Description: Package implements Kernel-based Regularized Least Squares (KRLS), a
    machine learning method to fit multidimensional functions y=f(x) for regression
    and classification problems without relying on linearity or additivity
    assumptions. KRLS finds the best fitting function by minimizing the squared loss
    of a Tikhonov regularization problem, using Gaussian kernels as radial basis
    functions. For further details see Hainmueller and Hazlett (2014).
